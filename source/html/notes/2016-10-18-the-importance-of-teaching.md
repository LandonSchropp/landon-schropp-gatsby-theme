Teaching is a way of depth ending your knowledge about a topic Try to think about marketing as
teaching, not selling. Teaching is also a great ways to build trust and keep people coming back.

Be honest. **Your vulnerability attracts people to your brand.**

If you're not sure where to start, teach people about what you're learning. Many companies/blogs get
started this way. You don't need permission to teach. Instead, think of it more as sharing what you
know. You don't have to be some kind of certified expert.

Who are you? What are you struggling with and tying to learn? Share what you're going through.
