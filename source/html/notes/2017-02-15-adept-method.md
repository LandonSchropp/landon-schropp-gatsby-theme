Kalid gives a nice overview of learning difficult topics with the ADEPT method. I think this applies
equally well to teaching.

* **Analogy:** <q>Analogies are fuzzy, not 100% accurate, and yet astoundingly useful. They’re a
  raft to get across the river, and leave behind once you’ve crossed.</q>
* **Diagram:** Find a way to *visualize* the topic.  If half your brain is dedicated to visual
  processing, you might as well use that.
* **Experience:** Let people make progress for themselves. Don't take the fun out of it.
* **Plain-English description:** Describe the idea in your own words.
* **Technical description:** Finally, translate the concept into its formal definition.

When learning something new, take the blurry to sharp approach.

> Start with a rough analogy and sharpen it until you’re covering the technical details.
