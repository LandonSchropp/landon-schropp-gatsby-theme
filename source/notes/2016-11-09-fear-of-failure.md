> You don’t get to what’s next if you stay in that fear zone and don’t activity.

> Just act. Just do stuff. Don’t worry so much about whether it’s going to work or not, as long as
> you feel like it’s the right thing to do.

> Is the only reason you are or aren't doing something out of fear? Of so, ask yourself if there's a
> better way. Don't let that be the only deciding factor.
