AI isn't inherently good or evil. It's a *tool* for people to use. When used correctly, it has the
potential to save a lot of lives.

We have to distinguish between *intelligence* and *autonomy*. The
[AlphaGo AI](https://deepmind.com/research/alphago/) might be hyper-intelligent, but it doesn't have
any autonomy. It can't decide to work on a different problem. It can't play a different game. It
doesn't even know if it's won or lost.

When it comes to AI weapons, **the scary part isn't intelligence, it's autonomy.**

> It's the absence of AI technologies that are already killing people.
