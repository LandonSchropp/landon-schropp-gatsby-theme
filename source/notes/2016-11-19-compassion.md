**Compassion can be a powerful catalyst.**

Tim Dawes defines compassion as *finding fundamental human needs.* We need to re-imagine compassion
not as "warmness", but as a concrete set of practices.

1. Listen for a call for help.
2. Share empathy.
3. Share options.

This model is broadly applicable across domains and systems.

Don't aim to affect people's actions, aim to affect the needs underlying them. Ask somebody "What do
you need?" It's not about domination, it's about collaboration. The solutions have to work for both
parties to be effective.

> Compassion, if done deliberately, can turn enemies into allies.
