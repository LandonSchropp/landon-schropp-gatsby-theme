> The Overton Window is the range of ideas that the public will accept. It’s primarily used in
> politics and media.

As ideas gain support, they tend to move in this direction:

Unthinkable → Radical →  Acceptable → Sensible → Popular → Policy

The Overton Window is everything past acceptable.

> When it comes to your career, you want to try and live on the edge of the Overton Window,
> somewhere between radical and acceptable.

> If you pursue ideas and opportunities which are popular and sensible today, you are on the path to
> being commoditized.

> People err on both sides of this spectrum. Some don’t master the fundamentals first, they try to
> innovate without a full understanding of where the Overton Window even is. If you’ve never written
> a book, don’t try to reinvent the genre. Figure out the best practices and copy them. Others
> master the fundamental and then get stuck. They never dance to the edge. In our quest for
> certainty, we guarantee failure.

> There is an ideal amount of innovation for commercial success. I think the ratio is about 90%
> copy, 10% radical.
