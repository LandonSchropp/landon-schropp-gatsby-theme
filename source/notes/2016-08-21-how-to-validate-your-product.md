Email people and ask if they could take the time to quickly give you feedback on an idea. If they
say yes, send them an email in the format:

* Idea Problem Example Benefits Price

At the end, add the line: *Even if you only have time to answer with a yes or no, it would be a big
help.* Try to get ten yeses.

Send out a survey to the product launch list digging into what they’re looking for.

1. Pick the right early customers
2. Become a developer for hire
3. Rush through creating features, but take your time getting the next customer on-boarded
4. Build features one at a time as your customer needs them.

When you're ready to launch, send out an email with the subject *XXX is Ready*. After the first
customer is satisfied, repeat for the second, third, fourth, etc. Make sure to include a
time-limited discount.

**Minimum Path to Awesome (MPA)**: The minimum number of steps the user needs to take in order to
have that “ah ha” moment.
