Finding people to talk to is a hustle. *Beg, borrow, lie and steal* to get interviews.

Some prompt ideas:

* <q>Hey, I’m doing research on X</q>
* <q>Hey, I’m working on something to help solve problem X. Mind if I ask you a few questions about
  it?</q>
* <q>I'd love to talk about what you do every day.</q> People love talking about themselves.
* <q>Please tell me about a time a marketing campaign failed…</q>
* <q>Tell me about your experience with X.</q>
* <q>Could you show me how you use X?</q>

After you’ve found somebody to talk to, *don’t ask for feedback on your product or try to bias their
opinion.* <q>You're going to get what you're seeking.</q> Ask open-ended questions.

Ask the question and shut up. Don't lead the witness. <q>Your intent should be to learn about them,
not get validation about your idea.</q>

**Look for stories**. It’s the best way to identify problems. You know you’re on the right track
when people have lots of stories to tell you.
