**Always question the obvious.**

> Whenever you find yourself on the site of the majority, it’s time to pause and reflect.

> When you learn to think creatively about one thing, you start to think creatively about everything
> else.

> Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there’s nothing more to
> take away.
> --Antoine de Saint Exupéry

## The DiSSS Method

1. **Deconstruction:** Identify why you might fail before you start. The goal is to avoid those
   problems for at least the first five sessions.
2. **Selection:** Try to identify the 20% of activities that determine 80% of the results (The 80/20
   Principle)
3. **Sequencing:**  What if you did things out of order? What if you omitted the things that people
   say are best practices, but don’t really matter?
4. **Stakes (Consequences):** It is extremely effective to build incentives into whatever behavioral
   changes you want to acquire.

The overlying principle of all of this is to **simplify**. When you’re looking for solutions, try to
remove things before trying to add things.

## Takeaways

* The first step is to be very confident. You have to have optimism that you can achieve beyond your
  personal limitations.
* You need to establish a baseline so you can see progress.
* The 80/20 rule can also be applied to equipment and gear.
* The worst time to learn something is when you’re under pressure. Find a way to take the pressure
  away. For example, to learn to chop with a chef's knife, try practicing with a lettuce knife.
