There are two kinds of procrastination:

* **The kind with deadlines.** This type isn’t so bad because the procrastination is contained.
  Eventually, you hit your deadline and either get your shit done or not.
* **The kind without deadlines.** This is much harder to deal with. If you don’t do anything,
  nothing will happen. This is the kind of procrastination that’s deadly to entrepreneurs.
  <q>It’s usually suffered quietly and privately and it can be the source of a huge amount of
  long-term unhappiness and regret.</q>

> Long-term procrastination has made [procrastinators] feel like a spectator in their own lives. The
> frustrations was not that they couldn’t achieve their dreams, it’s that they weren’t even able to
> start chasing them.

Non-procrastinators don’t exist. Some people handle it better than others, but everyone has a monkey
mind.
